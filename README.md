### Non-urgent to do list:
- add more rules checks (binding rule, every value unique in each row)
- improve faulty matrix handling. Now if a matrix attribute accidently follows a rule, a totally new matrix is created. It would make more sense to only change the attribute that follows the rule. Would need to create new function for that
