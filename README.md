# OMMS_generator
### Current to do list
- create all the rules
- add render module
- alternatives

### Broader picture/horizons
- add binding rule (and checks for it)
- create more complicated configurations (allowing new rules such as arithmetic and position) (note to self, probably easiest to adjust current 2-d matrices to the 3-d ones, with the z-axis referring to the addinational entities in a cell)

### Non-urgent to do list:
-  improve  matrix handling. Now if a matrix attribute accidently follows a rule, a totally new matrix is created. It would make more sense to only change the attribute that follows the rule. Would need to create new function for that
